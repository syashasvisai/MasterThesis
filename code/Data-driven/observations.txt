An important observation is that with more data, spaning the required initial conditions and various trajectories, the number of observables was brought down to same as the state. With lesser data, the observables were more and they had to include the 2nd degree polynomial terms. No difference was seen when the polynomial degree was increased. Infact, the angles went out of bounds.
