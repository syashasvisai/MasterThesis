\section{Preliminaries}
\label{Chapter:Prelims}
This chapter will introduce some concepts related to data-driven science and engineering that will be essential throughout the thesis and go beyond what can be considered as common knowledge. Accordingly, there will be no introduction into the basics of control theory. More suitable literature covering these topics is available in abundance, e.g. \cite{Ogata} or \cite{Skogestad}.
