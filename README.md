Title: Comparison of data-driven control algorithms using Koopman operator and LPV techniques for evaluating the tracking performance of an Arm-Driven Inverted Pendulum. 

This folder contains the files that are relevant to my Master Thesis. 

The Matlab and Simulink can be found in the code folder. 

The code folder has four parts.

1. Data-driven - Contains the code for data-driven control strategy
2. GA_ADIP - Contains the code for Genetic algorithms based tuner
3. qLMPC - Contains the code for qLPV-MPC control strategy
4. Swing-up + LQR - Contains the code for swing up of pendulum and LQR control strategy. 

The parameters.m and parameters.mat file contain the phsyical parameters for the Arm Driven Inverted Pendulum.
