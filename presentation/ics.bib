 abstract = {This  paper  proposes  a  method  for  frequency-weighted discrete-time linear parameter varying (LPV) model reduction  with  bounded  rate  of  parameter  variation,  using structurally balanced truncation with a priori (non-tight) upper error bounds for each xed parameter. For systems with both input and output weighting lters, guaranteed stability of the reduced-order model is proved as well as existence of solutions, provided that the full-order model is stable. A technique based on cone complementarity linearization is proposed to solve the associated LMI problem. Application to the model of a gantry robot illustrates the effectiveness of the approach. Moreover, a method is proposed to make the reduced order model suitable for practical LPV controller synthesis.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a method for the identication of  spatially  interconnected  system  in  rational  form,  using input-output data. Unlike previously proposed approaches, this method does not rely on a separability condition. The motivation for this approach is to identify a spatially interconnected model  in  Roesser  form  for  which  efcient  control  synthesis approaches have been recently proposed. The algorithm explicitly takes into consideration boundary conditions, which makes it  suitable  for  boundary  value  problems  such  as  conduction of heat through metal or vibration in xed, simply supported or cantilever beams. The approach is illustrated by applying it to a beam element with various boundary conditions. The effectiveness  of  the  method  is  demonstrated  by  a  controller synthesis based on the identied model.},

@inproceedings{AlChWe10,
 abstract = {A method for the identification of MIMO input-output LPV

models in closed-loop is proposed. The model is assumed to

display both linear and non-linear behavior in which the

latter is  dependent on the scheduling parameters, and

cubic splines are used to represent the non-linear

dependence. For the estimation of both linear and

non-linear parameters, the separable least square method is

employed. The linear parameters are obtained by a least

square identification algorithm, while the non-linear

parameters are obtained using a recursive

Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. To identify such a model in

closed-loop, we use a non-linear version of a two-step

method. A neural network ARX model will be used in the

first step for two purposes. Firstly, to generate

noise-free input signal to get an unbiased model and

secondly to generate noise-free scheduling signal for

consistent identification. The proposed method is applied

to an arm-driven inverted pendulum. The resulting model is

compared with a linear time-invariant model, and with an

LPV model that depends polynomially on the scheduling

parameters. Experimental results indicate that the cubic

spline model outperforms the other ones in terms of

accuracy.},

 abstract = {This article sets out the rudiments of a theory for analyzing and creating architectures appropriate to the control of formations of autonomous vehicles. The theory rests on ideas of rigid graph theory, some but not all of which are old. The theory, however, has some gaps in it, and their elimination would help in applications. Some of the gaps in the relevant graph theory are as follows. First, there is as yet no analogue for three-dimensional graphs of Laman's theorem, which provides a combinatorial criterion for rigidity in two-dimensional graphs. Second, for three-dimensional graphs there is no analogue of the two-dimensional Henneberg construction for growing or deconstructing minimally rigid graphs although there are conjectures. Third, global rigidity can easily be characterized for two-dimensional graphs, but not for three-dimensional graphs.},

By relating the insights from modal analysis to system theory, necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for linear mechanical systems to have the DTM property.

 abstract = {Reservoir Computing (RC) techniques use a fixed (usually randomly created) recurrent neural network, or more generally any dynamic system, which operates at the edge of stability, where only a linear static readout output layer is trained by standard linear regression methods. In this work, RC is used for detecting complex events in autonomous robot navigation. This can be extended to robot localization tasks which are solely based on a few low-range, high-noise sensory data. The robot thus builds an implicit map of the environment (after learning) that is used for efficient localization by simply processing the input stream of distance sensors. These techniques are demonstrated in both a simple simulation environment and in the physically realistic Webots simulation of the commercially available e-puck robot, using several complex and even dynamic environments.},

@article{ApAd98,
 abstract = {This paper is concerned with the design of gain-scheduled controllers for uncertain linear parameter-varying systems. Two alternative design techniques for constructing such controllers are discussed. Both techniques are amenable to linear matrix inequality problems via a gridding of the parameter space and a selection of basis functions. These problems are then readily solvable using available tools in convex semidefinite programming. When used together, these techniques provide complementary advantages of reduced computational burden and ease of controller implementation. The problem of synthesis for robust performance is then addressed by a new scaling approach for gain-scheduled control. The validity of the theoretical results are demonstrated through a two-link flexible manipulator design example. This is a challenging problem that requires scheduling of the controller in the manipulator geometry and robustness in face of uncertainty in the high-frequency range},

We first model the time varying delay system as an interconnected system between a known linear transformation and some operators depending explicitly on the delay. Embedding operators related to the delay into an uncertain set, stability of such system is then performed by adopting the quadratic separation approach. Having recognized that the conservatism comes from the choice of the feedback modeling and the operators definition, these first results are afterwards enhanced by using some redundant equation and scaling filter. At last, numerical examples are given to illustrate the results.},

The time-delay is assumed to be a time-varying continuous function belonging to an interval (possibly excluding zero) with a bound on its derivative. To this end, we propose to use the quadratic separation framework to assess the intervals on the delay that preserves the stability. Nevertheless, to take the time-varying nature of the delay into account, the quadratic separation principle has to be extended to cope with the general case of time-varying operators. The key idea lies in rewording the delay system as a feedback interconnection consisting of operators that characterize it. The original feature of this contribution is to design a set of additional auxiliary operators that enhance the system modelling and reduce the conservatism of the methodology. Then, separation conditions lead to linear matrix inequality conditions which can be efficiently solved with available semi-definite programming algorithms.

These conditions can be checked numerically with linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based convex optimization using the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma. We show how LMI tests also yield a convex parametrization of (a subset of) Lyapunov functionals that prove robust stability of such uncertain systems. We show that for uncertainties that are pure delays, the Lyapunov functionals reduce to the standard Lyapunov-Krasovksii functionals that are encountered in the stability analysis of delay systems. We demonstrate the practical utility of the Lyapunov functional parametrization by deriving bounds for a number of measures of robust performance (beyond the usual H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\&}infin;{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} performance); these bounds can be efficiently computed using convex optimization over linear matrix inequalities.},

@article{BaPaDa02,
 abstract = {We consider distributed parameter systems where the underlying dynamics are spatially invariant, and where the controls and measurements are spatially distributed. These systems arise in many applications such as the control of vehicular platoons, flow control, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), smart structures, and systems described by partial differential equations with constant coefficients and distributed controls and measurements. For fully actuated distributed control problems involving quadratic criteria such as linear quadratic regulator (LQR), H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\&}infin;{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, optimal controllers can be obtained by solving a parameterized family of standard finite-dimensional problems. We show that optimal controllers have an inherent degree of decentralization, and this provides a practical distributed controller architecture. We also prove a general result that applies to partially distributed control and a variety of performance criteria, stating that optimal controllers inherit the spatial invariance structure of the plant. Connections of this work to that on systems over rings, and systems with dynamical symmetries are discussed},

 abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of distributed controller design in spatially invariant systems for which communication among sites is limited. In particular, the controller is constrained so that information is propagated with a delay that depends on the distance between subsystems---a structure we refer to as ``funnel'' causality. We show that the problem of optimal design can be cast as a convex problem provided that the plant has a similar funnel-causality structure, and the propagation speeds in the controller are at least as fast as those in the plant. As an example, we consider the case of the wave dynamics with limited propagation speed control.},

@article{Bl00,
 abstract = {We consider dynamical uncertain systems of the form x{\&}dot;=a(x, w)+b(x, w)u where w(t){\&}isin;W is an unknown but bounded time-varying parameter. We consider the robust state feedback stabilization problem, in which we consider a control of the form u={\&}Phi;(x), and the gain-scheduling stabilization problem in which a control of the form u={\&}Phi;(x, w) (full information control) is admitted. We show that for convex processes, those systems in which for fixed x the set of all [a(x, w)b(x, w)] is convex, the two problems are equivalent; i.e., if there exists a (locally Lipschitz) gain scheduling stabilizing control then there exists a robustly stabilizing control (continuous everywhere except possibly at the origin). Thus, for convex process stabilization, knowledge of w(t) is not an advantage for the compensator. Then we consider the special class of polytopic LPV systems, and show that there is no loss of regularity as in the general case, if we pass from a gain-scheduling controller to a state feedback controller. In particular, no discontinuity at the origin may occur. We show that the existence of a dynamic controller always implies the existence of a static one. Finally we show that we can always find a linear gain-scheduling controller for a stabilizable system. This means that a possible advantage of the online measurement of the parameter w(t) is that this always allows for linear compensators, whose implementation can be easier than that of nonlinear ones.},

 abstract = {We consider a set of identical decoupled dynamical systems and a control problem where the performance index couples the behavior of the systems. The coupling is described through a communication graph where each system is a node and the control action at each node is only function of its state and the states of its neighbors. A distributed control design method is presented which requires the solution of a single LQR problem. The size of the LQR problem is equal to the maximum vertex degree of the communication graph plus one. The design procedure proposed in this paper illustrates how stability of the large-scale system is related to the robustness of local controllers and the spectrum of a matrix representing the sparsity pattern of the distributed controller design problem},

@inproceedings{BoWe10,
 abstract = {A method for the identification of MIMO input-output LPV

models in closed-loop is proposed. The model is assumed to

display both linear and non-linear behavior in which the

latter is  dependent on the scheduling parameters, and

cubic splines are used to represent the non-linear

dependence. For the estimation of both linear and

non-linear parameters, the separable least square method is

employed. The linear parameters are obtained by a least

square identification algorithm, while the non-linear

parameters are obtained using a recursive

Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. To identify such a model in

closed-loop, we use a non-linear version of a two-step

method. A neural network ARX model will be used in the

first step for two purposes. Firstly, to generate

noise-free input signal to get an unbiased model and

secondly to generate noise-free scheduling signal for

consistent identification. The proposed method is applied

to an arm-driven inverted pendulum. The resulting model is

compared with a linear time-invariant model, and with an

LPV model that depends polynomially on the scheduling

parameters. Experimental results indicate that the cubic

spline model outperforms the other ones in terms of

accuracy.�},

The present paper proposes a distributed solution in which a group of vehicles uniformly distributed in a fixed circular formation, estimates the gradient direction of the signal propagation. The distributed algorithm takes into account the communication constraints and depends on direct signal measurements. Our approach is based on the previous results in formation control to stabilize the fleet in a circular formation with time-varying center and in a collaborative source-seeking algorithm. The results are supported through computer simulations.},

For second order systems average consensus occurs when the information states tend toward the average of the current information states not their initial values. Lastly, perturbation to the consensus protocol is addressed.

 abstract = {In this note, a new result that extends the scaled small gain theorem is presented. As is well known, the scaled small gain theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for robust stability of a nominal linear time-invariant system in feedback with structured operators of norm less than or equal to unity. We propose alternative linear matrix inequality conditions that give necessary and sufficient conditions for robust stability against the class of structured unitary operators (invertible operators of exactly unit norm). It is shown that this result, besides being a less conservative version of the scaled small gain theorem, has connections to several recent results on the control of spatially interconnected systems and serves to unify and quantify the conservatism of those results.},

 abstract = {Measuring a patients' oxygen consumption (VO2) is valuable in critical care and during anesthesia. Up to now, there has been no satisfactory equation describing the relation between the VO2, the fresh gas, and F(I)O(2) in a semi-closed circle breathing system. By adopting a {\dq}volume-weighted average concentration{\dq} approach and stepwise calculations, we have proposed an equation. We constructed a model with known simulated O(2) consumption ((SIM)VO2) to test our equation and two other previous methods (Biro's and Azami's). After 32 different laboratory scenarios, the {\%}-error of the calculated VO2 ((CAL)VO2) from our method is -4.0 +/- 2.9{\%}, which is significantly better than those from Azami's method (-8.8 +/- 6.2{\%}, p {\textless} 0.01) and from Biro's method (-27.4 +/- 5.1{\%}, p {\textless} 0.01). We also produce a Bland-Altman analysis of our (CAL)VO2 and (SIM)VO2. The 95{\%} limits of agreement are -18.6-3.3 mL/min with a mean bias of -7.7 mL/min, which shows a good agreement. Our equation also explains the difference between F(I)O(2) and the oxygen concentration of the fresh gas in a semi-closed circle breathing system.},

 abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of output synchronization in multi-agent systems where the coupling among the agents is nonlinear and there are time delays in communication. We assume that dynamics of each agent are passive with a positive definite storage function. In the delay free case, the output synchronization results for nonlinear coupling closely follow our earlier results with linear coupling. We show that if the agents are coupled using passive nonlinear controls, namely a class of sector nonlinearities, the agents output synchronizes. In the case of linear coupling among the agents, we have shown previously that the outputs synchronize for various communication topologies even with time delay in communication. The case of nonlinear coupling with delay is more difficult. In this paper we show that output synchronization is achievable with modified communication architecture. Instead of sending the output of each agent across the communication channel, we first encode the output information using the scattering variables, and we transmit the scattering variables across the network. The scattering variable formulation pacifies the communication channel and allows output synchronization independent of the (constant) communication delay},

 abstract = {This paper presents the controller synthesis of a network of local robust controllers for the purpose of controlling the transition from laminar to turbulent ow in non-periodic channels,  using  a  recently  proposed  spatially  interconnected model  of  plane  Poiseuille  ow  for  Re = 2000.  Measured feedback signals used by the controllers are the local changes in wall shear force, and the generated control action is a local change in uid wall normal velocities. Thus, in contrast to most previously proposed control schemes which operate in Fourier domain, this approach works in physical domain. In order to  synthesize this controller, rst uncertainties are estimated by nding the relative error between the measurements obtained from  linearized  and  non-linear  models.  For  this  purpose  a non-linear  simulation  environment  is  developed  in  FLUENT software. Once these uncertainties are estimated in frequency domain, a low order spatially interconnected weighting function is found. The closed  loop response shows that the controller attenuates oscillations generated by an impulsive disturbance.},

 abstract = {Abstract

The paper is concerned with the problem of distributed model predictive control (DMPC) for formation of multiple linear second-order agents with collision avoidance and obstacle avoidance. All the agents are permitted to implement optimization simultaneously at each time step. The assumed input trajectory and state trajectory are introduced to obtain a computationally tractable optimization problem in a distributed manner. As a result, a compatibility constraint is required to ensure the consistency between each agent׳s real operation and its plan and to establish the agreement among agents. The terminal ingredients are tailored by making use of the specific form of the system model and the control objective. The terminal set is ensured to be positively invariant with the designed terminal controller. The collision avoidance constraint and the obstacle avoidance constraint are satisfied for any state in the terminal set. The weighted matrix of the terminal cost is determined by solving a Lyapunov equation. Moreover, recursive feasibility of the resulting optimization problem is guaranteed and closed-loop stability of the whole system is ensured. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

A set of LMI conditions are derived for robust L2-gain performance of such a system in the framework of multiplier-based LPV synthesis. The results have been oriented to be applied in traffic flow control in motorways by ramp metering. First, with the use of a proper transformation, the nonlinear traffic flow model has been represented as the interconnection of LPV subsystems. Then the developed synthesis results have been used to design a gain-scheduled distributed state-feedback controller that keeps the density of all segments around a desired value by the use of ramp metering.},

 abstract = {This paper considers two cooperative control problems for nonholonomic mobile agents. In the first problem, we discuss the design of cooperative control laws such that a group of nonholonomic mobile agents cooperatively converges to some stationary point under various communication scenarios. Dynamic control laws for each agent are proposed with the aid of sigma-processes and results from graph theory. In the second problem, we discuss the design of cooperative control laws such that a group of mobile agents converges to and tracks a target point which moves along a desired trajectory under various communication scenarios. By introducing suitable variable transformations, cooperative control laws are proposed. Since communication delay is inevitable in cooperative control, in each of the above cooperative control problems, we analyze the effect of delayed communication on the proposed controllers. As applications of the proposed results, formation control of wheeled mobile robots is discussed. It is shown that our results can be successfully used to solve formation control problem.

 abstract = {Recently, distributed robust output feedback control synthesis has been considered for a subclass of interconnected linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems, referred to as decomposable systems. In the synthesis procedure, the interconnection and the LPV uncertainty are described as linear fractional transformations (LFTs), and conditions derived by the full block S-procedure are solved iteratively. Here different approaches are presented to reduce the size of the LFT channels and thus the number of variables in the synthesis. Furthermore, an alternative synthesis procedure is presented, which in contrast to previously reported results avoids the inversion of multipliers.},

@article{FaMu04,
 abstract = {We consider the problem of cooperation among a collection of vehicles performing a shared task using intervehicle communication to coordinate their actions. Tools from algebraic graph theory prove useful in modeling the communication network and relating its topology to formation stability. We prove a Nyquist criterion that uses the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix to determine the effect of the communication topology on formation stability. We also propose a method for decentralized information exchange between vehicles. This approach realizes a dynamical system that supplies each vehicle with a common reference to be used for cooperative motion. We prove a separation principle that decomposes formation stability into two components: Stability of this is achieved information flow for the given graph and stability of an individual vehicle for the given controller. The information flow can thus be rendered highly robust to changes in the graph, enabling tight formation control despite limitations in intervehicle communication capability.},

 abstract = {The authors consider three different versions of a candidate booster vehicle design. The vehicle is difficult to control due to an aerodynamic instability, lightly damped flex modes a decade beyond the aerodynamic instability, and lightly damped slosh modes near the instability. The latter are almost uncontrollable due to vehicle geometry. The task is to assess the degree of design difficulty associated with the presence or absence of propellant slosh baffles in the LOX and LH2 fuel tanks. An open loop analysis of the design difficulty is first performed, and then controllers are synthesized using the McFarlane-Glover (MFG) and the structured singular value (SSV) synthesis methodologies. Robustness is analyzed using SSV techniques for complex, real, and mixed uncertainty structures.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of deploying a group of autonomous vehicles (agents) in a formation which has higher density near the source of a measurable signal and lower density away from the source. The spatial distribution of the signal and the location of the source are unknown but the signal is known to decay with the distance from the source. The vehicles do not have the capability of sensing their own positions but they are capable of sensing the distance between them and their neighbors. We design a control algorithm based on a combination of two components. One component of the control law is inspired by the heat PDE and it results in the agents deploying between two anchor agents. The other component of the control law is based on extremum seeking and it achieves higher vehicle density around the source. Using averaging theory for PDE's we prove that the vehicle density will be highest around the source. We also quantify the spatial density function. By discretizing the model with respect to the continuous agent index, we obtain decentralized control laws for discrete agents and illustrate the theoretical results with simulations.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of designing distributed controller for networks of dynamic systems called decomposable systems with switching network topologies. Exploiting certain structural property associated with state space matrices of these systems, a modal decomposition approach is used to design a distributed controller that has the same interconnection structure as the networks in each instance; i.e. controller structure changes according to network topologies without any delay. An explicit expression for computing the controller parameters is derived using LMI approach under H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} or H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}$\infty${\textless}/sub{\textgreater} criteria with D-stability property. Moreover, a simple sufficient condition for the existence of such a controller is provided that ensures the stability of the network with any arbitrary switching provided that the networks switch among a finite set of admissible topologies. The simulations results are provided to support the theoretical development.},

 abstract = {In this technical note, we consider the problem of designing distributed controller for a continuous-time system composed of a number of identical dynamically coupled subsystems. The underlying mathematical derivation is based on Kronecker product and a special similarity transformation constructed from interconnection pattern matrix that decomposes the system into modal subsystems. This along with the result of extended linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulation for continuous-time systems makes it possible to derive explicit expressions for computing the parameters of distributed controllers for both static state feedback and dynamic output feedback cases. The main contribution of the technical note is the solution of distributed control problem for continuous-time systems under {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}$\infty${\textless}/sub{\textgreater}/ \textgreek{a}-stability and {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}/ \textgreek{a}-stability performances by solving a set of LMIs with noncommon Lyapunov variables. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by means of a satellite formation example.},

 abstract = {In this paper we describe how a population of evolving robots can autonomously develop forms of spatial representation that allow them to discriminate different locations of their environment. Developed representation forms consist of patterns of activations of internal neurons that are generated by integrating sequences of sensory-motor states while the robots interact autonomously with their environment. Moreover, these representation forms are allocentric, i.e. they allow evolved robots to identify a given spatial location independently from the robots' initial position and orientation in the environment. The analysis on the robots' representation system indicate that it can be characterized as a limit cycle resulting from the transient dynamic between fixed attractor points that alternate while the robot move in the environment. We also demonstrate how the evolved representation systems display remarkable generalization properties. We conclude the paper by discussing the characteristics of the representation system developed by the robots and its relation with other models described in the literature},

 abstract = {Plant structure is utilized for the simplification of system analysis and controller synthesis. For plants where the directionality is independent of frequency, the singular-value decompositioin (SVD) is used to decouple the system into nominally independent subsystems of lower dimension. In H2$-$ and H$\infty$$-$optimal control, the controller synthesis can then be performed for each of these subsystems independently, and the resulting overall SVD controller will be optimal (the same will hold for any norm that is invariant under unitary transformations). In H$\infty$$-$optimal control the resulting controller is also super-optimal, since a controller of dimension n $\times$ n will minimize the norm in n directions. For robust control in terms of the structured singular value \textgreek{m}, the SVD controller is optimal for a practically relevant class of block-diagonal structures and uncertainty and performance weights.},

@inproceedings{HoHaAbWe12,
 abstract = {A major difficulty encountered in the application of linear parameter-varying (LPV) control is the complexity of synthesis and implementation when the number of scheduling parameters is large. Often heuristic ad hoc solutions involve the neglection of individual scheduling parameters, such that standard LPV controller synthesis methods become applicable. The principle component analysis (PCA) based technique of parameter set mapping (PSM) has been proposed as a systematic way for obtaining LPV models with fewer scheduling parameters. However, controller designs based on an approximate model cannot guarantee stability and performance when implemented on the original plant. In this paper, a posteriori conditions are proposed to assess closed-loop stability and performance. Moreover, a possible synthesis approach is sketched based on iterating between convex optimization problems. A two-degree-of- freedom (2-DOF) robotic manipulator is considered as an illustrative example.},

@article{HoSk94,
 abstract = {This paper is concerned with control of plants composed of n similar interacting subsystems. Such plants are common in practice and include paper machines, distribution networks, coating processes, and plants consisting of units operating in parallel. The transfer function matrices for these systems are block symmetric circulant. For H$\infty$- and H2-optimal control, controller synthesis is simplified by considering n2 + 1 independent problems of dimension n times smaller than the original problem. For the case of H$\infty$-optimal control this also yields `super-optimality', where the H$\infty$ criterion is optimized in n directions, and not only in the worst direction. If the offdiagonal blocks (`interactions') are identical the matrix is termed block parallel, and controller synthesis involves only two independent subproblems of the same dimension as the subsystems. This leads to a dramatic reduction in dimension for systems composed of many subsystems.},

 abstract = {Fault detection, isolation, and reconfiguration (FDIR) is an important and challenging problem in many engineering applications and continues to be an active area of research in the control community. This paper presents a survey of the various model-based FDIR methods developed in the last decade. In the paper, the FDIR problem is divided into the fault detection and isolation (FDI) step, and the controller reconfiguration step. For FDI, we discuss various model-based techniques to generate residuals that are robust to noise, unknown disturbance, and model uncertainties, as well as various statistical techniques of testing the residuals for abrupt changes (or faults). We then discuss various techniques of implementing reconfigurable control strategy in response to faults.},

algorithms have been used to find efficient locations of piezoelectric sensors and actuators of a

smart composite place. Locations of both sensors and actuators have been determined with

consideration of controllability, observability and spillover prevention. The composite specimen

with piezoelectric sensors and actuators has been prepared according to the optimization result. The

experimental vibration control shows significant vibration reduction for the controlled modes with

little effect on the residual modes. In addition, the closed loop system is observed to be robust

 abstract = {In this paper, it is shown how derivative bounds on uncertain time-varying parameters can be exploited in robustness analysis of linear systems. A new stability criterion is derived, based on integral quadratic constraints in the frequency domain. The new stability criterion interpolates between well known robust stability results, which are obtained in the limit. As the derivative bounds tend to zero, the new criterion turns into the usual upper bound for the structured singular value. The stability analysis, which involves a search for suitable multipliers, can be formulated as a convex optimization problem in terms of linear matrix inequalities},

 abstract = {In this work, a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) control method is used to compensate the hysteretic behavior of a Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wire. Controller is implemented on an experimental system which consists of a pre-tension spring and a mass actuated with a thin SMA wire. The hysteretic characteristic of the SMA wire is modeled using the Preisach model and the model is verified both for the major and minor hysteresis loops. The small signal linear gain of the Preisach model is used as a scheduling stiffness variable. The parameter-dependent controller is scheduled based on the real time measurement of the stiffness variable. An H$\infty$ controller is also synthesized by representing the hysteresis as a parametric uncertainty and comparisons are made with LPV gain scheduling controllers using similar weights for both controllers. Experimental trajectory tracking results show that the LPV Gain Scheduling controller has a better response and the hysteresis uncertainty is compensated for the full range of stiffness variability.},

 abstract = {Robust stability analysis problem is considered for linear time-invariant systems subject to perturbations of parameters that vary smoothly in time. The problem is formulated by describing the uncertainty in the form of a region-of-variation that covers all possible trajectories obtained by plotting the variation of the parameter at a certain time versus the parameter itself at that same instant of time. In this fashion, the possible and very probable correlation between the parameter and its variation is taken into account. The problem is elaborated on via an integral quadratic constraints approach and, based on a main result relying on the swapping lemma, robust stability analysis tests are derived for polytopic regions of variation as well as for regions with generic descriptions expressed in terms of matrix inequalities. The tests for polytopic regions-of-variation are based on the convex hull and Polya relaxation approaches, whereas the test for general regions relies on the sum-of-squares relaxation approach. The new tests offer significant reduction in conservatism at the cost of extra computational complexity},

when a state trajectory exceeds a predefined threshold signal can be determined for input signals

by transforming the switching conditions in the Orthogonal Function Domain of the Legendre

polynomials. The problem of predicting the event time can be transposed into the problem of finding

the minimal, positive and real root of a polynomial. In general, the event time can not be

determined exactly, but approximated with sufficient accuracy.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the design and experimental test of a fixed-structure LPV controller for the charge control of a spark-ignition engine. A nonlinear model of the plant is transformed into an affine LPV model in the form of an LFT representation. Using a hybrid evolutionary-algebraic synthesis approach that combines LMI techniques based on K-S iteration with evolutionary search, a scheduled PID controller is designed. To reduce conservatism, the technique of quadratic separators is used in the analysis step. To improve tracking behavior, the gain scheduled feedback controller is supported by an LTI feedforward controller. The controller has been implemented on a standard electronic control unit, and experimental results on a test car illustrate that it meets the performance requirements in a wide range of operation.},

First, using tools inspired by dissipativity theory, we derive sufficient conditions in the form of finite-dimensional linear matrix inequalities when the interconnections are assumed to be ideal. These inequalities are coupled in a way that reflects the spatial structure of the problem and can be exploited to design distributed synthesis algorithms. We then investigate the case of lossy interconnection links and derive similar results for systems whose interconnection relations can be captured by a class of integral quadratic constraints that includes constant delays.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates a method for decentralized stabilization of vehicle formations using techniques from algebraic graph theory. The vehicles exchange information according to a pre-specified communication digraph, G. A feedback control is designed using relative information between a vehicle and its in-neighbors in G. We prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for an appropriate decentralized linear stabilizing feedback to exist is that G has a rooted directed spanning tree. We show the direct relationship between the rate of convergence to formation and the eigenvalues of the (directed) Laplacian of G. Various special situations are discussed, including symmetric communication graphs and formations with leaders. Several numerical simulations are used to illustrate the results.},

 abstract = {A method for optimal positioning of piezoelectric actuators and sensors on a flexible structure is presented. First, a two-dimensional (2-D) model of a piezoelectric actuator bonded to a plate is obtained. Then, a Ritz formulation is used to find a state model of the system in view of its control. To define an optimal positioning strategy, an energy based approach is developed. This leads quite naturally to the study of controllability and observability properties of the overall dynamical model. A new criterion based on energy assessment is proposed to locate actuators and sensors},

 abstract = {We consider a network of distributed sensors, where where each sensor takes a linear measurement of some unknown parameters, corrupted by independent Gaussian noises. We propose a simple distributed iterative scheme, based on distributed average consensus in the network, to compute the maximum-likelihood estimate of the parameters. This scheme doesn't involve explicit point-to-point message passing or routing; instead, it diffuses information across the network by updating each node's data with a weighted average of its neighbors' data (they maintain the same data structure). At each step, every node can compute a local weighted least-squares estimate, which converges to the global maximum-likelihood solution. This scheme is robust to unreliable communication links. We show that it works in a network with dynamically changing topology, provided that the infinitely occurring communication graphs are jointly connected.},

We first introduce a neighbor-based linear protocol with time-delay. Then we derive a sufficient condition in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for average consensus of the system. Furthermore, we discuss the case where the time-delay affects only the information that is being transmitted and show that consensus can be reached with arbitrary bounded time-delay. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

It can be represented as a rule--base, which can not be determined heuristically by an operator, even in case of simple plants, because it has too many rules. A systematic design method is proposed, which is based on a qualitative model of the plant.

 abstract = {Abstract

This paper concerns the problem of distributed controller synthesis for a class of heterogeneous distributed systems composed of \textgreek{a} ( 2 or more) different kinds of subsystems, interacting with one another according to a certain given graph topology. We will show that by employing Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) tools, namely the full-block S-procedure, we can derive a control synthesis method based on L 2 gain performance. This synthesis method guarantees stability and performance of a whole set of possible interconnection graphs, and its computational complexity does not depend on the number of subsystems involved but only on the number of different kinds of subsystems. The effectiveness of the new method is verified on a test case.},

@book{MaNe14,
 abstract = {The rapid evolution of computer science, communication, and information technology has enabled the application of control techniques to systems beyond the possibilities of control theory just a decade ago. Critical infrastructures such as electricity, water, trafficand intermodal transport networks are now in the scope of control engineers. The sheer size of such large-scale systems requires the adoption of advanced distributed control approaches. Distributed model predictive control (MPC) is one of the promising control methodologies for control of such systems. This book provides a state-of-the-art overview of distributed MPC approaches, while at the same time making clear directions of research that deserve more attention. The core and rationale of 35 approaches are carefully explained. Moreover, detailed step-by-step algorithmic descriptions of each approach are provided. These features make the book a comprehensive guide both for those seeking an introduction to distributed MPC as well as for those who want to gain a deeper insight in the wide range of distributed MPC techniques available.},

 abstract = {In this paper we present a theoretical and experimental result on the control of multi-agent non-holonomic systems. We design and implement a novel decentralized control scheme that achieves dynamic formation control and collision avoidance for a group of non-holonomic robots. First, we derive a feedback law using Lyapunov-type analysis that guarantees collision avoidance and tracking of a reference trajectory for a single robot. Then we extend this result to the case of multiple non-holonomic robots, and show how different multi-agent problems, such as formation control and leader---follower control, can be addressed in this framework. Finally, we combine the above results to address the problem of coordinated tracking for a group of agents. We give extensive experimental results that validate the effectiveness of our results in all three cases.},

If the state space matrices of these systems satisfy a certain structural property, then it is possible to derive a procedure for designing a distributed controller which has the same interconnection pattern as the plant. This procedure is basically a multiobjective optimization under linear matrix inequality constraints, with system norms as performance indices. The explicit expressions for computing these controllers are given for both {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}infin{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} or {\textless}i{\textgreater}H{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} performance, and both for static state feedback and dynamic output feedback (in discrete time).

 abstract = {This paper concerns the problem of distributed controller synthesis for a class of systems which we call ``decomposable systems''. These systems have a special property that makes it possible to decompose them into a set of modal systems and approach the distributed control problem in an easy and effective way. In a recent paper of ours, we have shown a suboptimal H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}$\infty${\textless}/sub{\textgreater} controller synthesis method based on the use of the multi-objective optimization technique making use of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs); in this article we show that another suboptimal approach is possible, which exploits robust control techniques, namely the full block S-procedure. In the end we also briefly show a method based on small gain H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}$\infty${\textless}/sub{\textgreater} robust performance synthesis, and the results of the three different methods are compared on a couple of test cases.},

This class of systems arises naturally in the context of distributed decision problems, coordination and rendezvous tasks and synchronization problems. The equilibrium set contains all states with identical state components. We present sufficient conditions guaranteeing uniform exponential stability of this equilibrium set, implying that all state components converge to a common value as time grows unbounded. Furthermore it is shown that this convergence result is robust with respect to an arbitrary delay, provided that the delay affects only the off-diagonal terms in the differential equation.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a multi-agent algorithm to address the source-seeking problem in which the task is to locate the source of some signal (e.g., a radio transmitter, a location of chemical contamination, etc.). This algorithm is based on the formation control work of another researcher in which they designed a control structure to stabilize a group of non-holonomic vehicles to a circular formation and also to move that formation by changing the location of its center. The source-seeking algorithm builds on these results by providing an outer-loop control law to move this circular formation towards a source. The resulting control law depends only on direct measurements of the signal to calculate an approximate gradient direction which is then used to steer the formation. Under certain assumptions about the spatial propagation of the signal this algorithm causes the center of the agents' formation to asymptotically converge to the location of the source.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we study the structural properties of optimal control of spatially distributed systems. Such systems consist of an infinite collection of possibly heterogeneous linear control systems that are spatially interconnected via certain distant-dependent coupling functions over arbitrary graphs. We study the structural properties of optimal control problems with infinite-horizon linear quadratic criteria, by analyzing the spatial structure of the solution to the corresponding operator Lyapunov and Riccati equations. The key idea of the paper is the introduction of a special class of operators called spatially decaying (SD). These operators are a generalization of translation invariant operators used in the study of spatially invariant systems. We prove that given a control system with a state-space representation consisting of SD operators, the solution of operator Lyapunov and Riccati equations are SD. Furthermore, we show that the kernel of the optimal state feedback for each subsystem decays in the spatial domain, with the type of decay (e.g., exponential, polynomial or logarithmic) depending on the type of coupling between subsystems.},

 abstract = {The robustness of consensus in single integrator multi-agent systems (MAS) to coupling delays and switching topologies is investigated. It is shown that consensus is reached for arbitrarily large constant, time-varying, or distributed delays if consensus is reached without delays. This delay robustness holds under the weakest possible connectivity assumptions on the underlying graph, i.e., as long as the graph is uniformly quasi-strongly connected and switches with a dwell-time. The proof is based on a contraction argument and allows to remove technical assumptions that were used in previous publications. Moreover, the result also applies to non-scalar single integrators, an important extension toward consensus and rendezvous in higher dimensions.},

Each vehicle in the group serves as a mobile sensor and the vehicle network as a mobile and reconfigurable sensor array. Our control strategy decouples, in part, the cooperative management of the network formation from the network maneuvers. The underlying coordination framework uses virtual bodies and artificial potentials. We focus on gradient climbing missions in which the mobile sensor network seeks out local maxima or minima in the environmental field. The network can adapt its configuration in response to the sensed environment in order to optimize its gradient climb.},

 abstract = {The problem of distributed Kalman filtering (DKF) for sensor networks is one of the most fundamental distributed estimation problems for scalable sensor fusion. This paper addresses the DKF problem by reducing it to two separate dynamic consensus problems in terms of weighted measurements and inverse-covariance matrices. These to data fusion problems are solved is a distributed way using low-pass and band-pass consensus filters. Consensus filters are distributed algorithms that allow calculation of average-consensus of time-varying signals. The stability properties of consensus filters is discussed in a companion CDC {\&}{\#}8217;05 paper [24]. We show that a central Kalman filter for sensor networks can be decomposed into n micro-Kalman filters with inputs that are provided by two types of consensus filters. This network of micro-Kalman filters collectively are capable to provide an estimate of the state of the process (under observation) that is identical to the estimate obtained by a central Kalman filter given that all nodes agree on two central sums. Later, we demonstrate that our consensus filters can approximate these sums and that gives an approximate distributed Kalman filtering algorithm. A detailed account of the computational and communication architecture of the algorithm is provided. Simulation results are presented for a sensor network with 200 nodes and more than 1000 links.},

@article{Ol06,
 abstract = {In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for design and analysis of distributed flocking algorithms. Two cases of flocking in free-space and presence of multiple obstacles are considered. We present three flocking algorithms: two for free-flocking and one for constrained flocking. A comprehensive analysis of the first two algorithms is provided. We demonstrate the first algorithm embodies all three rules of Reynolds. This is a formal approach to extraction of interaction rules that lead to the emergence of collective behavior. We show that the first algorithm generically leads to regular fragmentation, whereas the second and third algorithms both lead to flocking. A systematic method is provided for construction of cost functions (or collective potentials) for flocking. These collective potentials penalize deviation from a class of lattice-shape objects called {\&}alpha;-lattices. We use a multi-species framework for construction of collective potentials that consist of flock-members, or {\&}alpha;-agents, and virtual agents associated with {\&}alpha;-agents called {\&}beta;- and {\&}gamma;-agents. We show that migration of flocks can be performed using a peer-to-peer network of agents, i.e., {\dq}flocks need no leaders.{\dq} A {\dq}universal{\dq} definition of flocking for particle systems with similarities to Lyapunov stability is given. Several simulation results are provided that demonstrate performing 2-D and 3-D flocking, split/rejoin maneuver, and squeezing maneuver for hundreds of agents using the proposed algorithms.},

 abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical framework for analysis of consensus algorithms for multi-agent networked systems with an emphasis on the role of directed information flow, robustness to changes in network topology due to link/node failures, time-delays, and performance guarantees. An overview of basic concepts of information consensus in networks and methods of convergence and performance analysis for the algorithms are provided. Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms. A brief introduction is provided on networked systems with nonlocal information flow that are considerably faster than distributed systems with lattice-type nearest neighbor interactions. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the role of small-world effects on the speed of consensus algorithms and cooperative control of multivehicle formations},

 abstract = {In this paper, we discuss consensus problems for networks of dynamic agents with fixed and switching topologies. We analyze three cases: 1) directed networks with fixed topology; 2) directed networks with switching topology; and 3) undirected networks with communication time-delays and fixed topology. We introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. We establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. This required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. It turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. A disagreement function is a Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. A distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. We provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. Simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

Several tests for robust stability and performance with computable bounds for transfer functions and their state space realizations are compared, and a simple synthesis problem is studied. Uncertain systems are represented using Linear Fractional Transformations (LFTs) which naturally unify the frequency-domain and state space methods.},

In this technical note, we consider what effect multiple, non-commensurate (heterogeneous) communication delays can have on the consensus properties of large-scale multi-agent systems endowed with nonlinear dynamics. We show that the structure of the delayed dynamics allows functionality to be retained for arbitrary communication delays, even for switching topologies under certain connectivity conditions. The results are extended to the related problem of oscillator synchronization.},

Two kinds of networks are analyzed, i.e., directed networks with fixed topology and undirected networks with fixed topology and time-delay. For each of the networks, a sufficient and necessary condition is given to guarantee the consensus. It is proved that the largest tolerable time-delay is only related to the largest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the obtained results.},

 abstract = {Shock waves are special types of relatively short traffic jams that propagate opposite to the driving direction. These jams increase travel time, air pollution, and negatively impact safety. One way of dealing with shock waves is to impose dynamic speed limits to eliminate them. Control strategies proposed so far are based either on expert knowledge, or are centralized controllers with high computational demand, such as model predictive control. In this paper, we design decentralized feedback controllers with a fixed structure. For the purpose of design, we use a direct optimization technique capable of dealing with the design objectives and the non-linear character of the system. The advantages of using such simple controllers are that they do not require extensive on-line computations, use only local information and are therefore more attractive from the implementation point of view. We show that a simple, static control law achieves performance similar to previous results with centralized control for the considered scenario. The controller successfully resolves the shock wave and reduces the total time spent by 20{\%}, compared to the open-loop case.},

@article{PoHeBaWe08,
 abstract = {Dynamic speed limits can be used to eliminate shockwaves on freeways. Shockwaves are typically short traffic jams that emerge at bottlenecks and travel in the upstream direction on the freeway. These shockwaves lead to increased travel times and possibly to unsafe situations. A speed limit control approach to resolving shockwaves was developed based on a distributed controller design technique. The controller is distributed in the sense that each speed limit sign has its own controller. The controller parameters are optimized by numerical optimization, assuming that the controller structure and parameters are the same for each controller. The resulting performances are compared for several designs, differing in the controller order and the extent that the upstream and downstream traffic states are used as inputs for the controller. Other controllers known from the literature are based on switching schemes using local information only or are centralized model-based controllers with high computational loads. The proposed method gives a systematic way to design distributed controllers using the appropriate amount of upstream and downstream traffic information. The resulting controllers are attractive from the implementation point of view because they are very efficient. They do not require extensive online computations and use only information from the neighborhood. For the design scenario used, the controller successfully resolved the shockwave and reduced the total time spent by approximately 20{\%} compared with the uncontrolled case, which is comparable to the performance of the best controllers known from the literature.},

However,  since  these  methods  use  a  decomposition based  approach  to  reduce  the  complexity  of  the  MAS,  they cannot provide a guarantee of performance with the designed controller, and furthermore lead to conservative designs due to the Lyapunov shaping paradigm. This paper proposes a direct optimization gradient-based synthesis technique for a MAS with xed communication topology, exploiting the fact that the same controller is replicated on each agent. Although this results in a non-convex design problem, an appropriate initialization step makes  the  synthesis  efcient  and  helps  to  obtain  controllers with guaranteed  performance on the MAS},

 abstract = {This paper investigates two kinds of different consensus strategies for multi-vehicle systems with a time-varying reference velocity under directed communication topology, where the systems are modeled by double-integrator dynamics. For the fixed communication topology case, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for all the vehicles with reference velocity to reach consensus by the use of a new graphic methodology. We then extend this method to deal with the general case, that is, both the communication topologies and weighting factors are dynamically changing. In particular, it is shown that all the vehicles can reach consensus even though the dynamically changing interaction topology may not have a globally reachable node.},

@article{RaHaPh14,
 abstract = {Abstract --- In this paper, the multi-agent technology is applied in wireless sensor networks domain in order to adapt software architecture, and to optimize its performance in monitoring. We explore in particular the issues of topology control, especially some related work using multi-agent systems. In the third part, we will propose an agent-based algorithm for fault tolerance and topology control in a wireless sensor network. Our proposal consists of embedding an agent at each node that is responsible for selecting its parent or the next hop to the sink when transferring packets. The main contribution is the proposal of a new process of changing parent, which is based on the computation of a fault tolerance degree, calculated each time by the agent in cooperation with its neighboring nodes. Several parameters are exploited to calculate this metric, such as the number of hops, the energy and the quality of links. Simulation results show that this method of changing parent allows an enhanced lifetime, as well as network fault tolerance, when compared with the collection tree protocol.},

 abstract = {This paper considers the optimal placement of collocated piezoelectric actuator--sensor pairs on

flexible beams using a model-based linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller. A finite element

method based on Euler--Bernoulli beam theory is used. The contributions of piezoelectric sensor and

actuator patches to the mass and stiffness of the beam are considered. The LQR performance is taken

as the objective for finding the optimal location of sensor--actuator pairs. The problem is

formulated as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model control. The discrete optimal sensor and

actuator location problem is formulated in the framework of a zero--one optimization problem which is

solved using genetic algorithms (GAs). Classical control strategies like direct proportional

feedback, constant gain negative velocity feedback and the LQR optimal control scheme are applied to

study the control effectiveness. The study of the optimal location of actuators and sensors is

carried out for different boundary conditions of beams like cantilever, simply supported and clamped

boundary conditions.},

We show conditions on the sampling period and the control gain such that consensus is reached using these two algorithms over, respectively, an undirected interaction topology and a directed interaction topology. In particular, necessary and sufficient conditions are shown in the case of undirected interaction while sufficient conditions are shown in the case of directed interaction.

 abstract = {We revisit a technique for solving multi-objective control problems through affinely parameterizing the closed-loop system with the Youla parameterization and confining the search of the Youla parameter to finite-dimensional subspaces. It is pretty well-known how to solve such problems if the closed-loop specifications are formulated in terms of the solvability of linear matrix inequalities. However, all approaches proposed so far suffer from a substantial inflation of size of the resulting optimization problems if improving the approximation accuracy. On the basis of a novel state-space approach to solving static output feedback control problems by convex optimization for a specific class of plants, we reveal how the growth of the size of the optimization problems can be considerably reduced to arrive at more efficient algorithms. As an additional ingredient we discuss how to use the so-called mixed controller as a starting point for a genuine multi-objective design in order to improve the algorithms.},

As an illustration we apply the technique to robust quadratic and robust generalized H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} performance, and we comment on the wide range of its applicability. Finally, we reveal how this technique allows us to approach LPV (linear parameter varying) problems in which the control input and measurement output matrix are parameter dependent. The latter is made possible by letting the parameter enter the LPV controller via a kernel representation that generalizes the more conventional LFT structure},

Some examples are modern light-weight flexible robots and articulated manipulators with passive joints. This book investigates such underactuated multibody systems from an integrated perspective. This includes all major steps from the modeling of rigid and flexible multibody systems, through nonlinear control theory, to optimal system design. The underlying theories and techniques from these different fields are presented using a self-contained and unified approach and notation system. Subsequently, the book focuses on applications to large multibody systems with multiple degrees of freedom, which require a combination of symbolical and numerical procedures. Finally, an integrated, optimization-based design procedure is proposed, whereby both structural and control design are considered concurrently.},

 abstract = {Vehicles are complex systems (non-linear, multi-variable) where the abundance of embedded controllers should ensure better security. This book aims at emphasizing the interest and potential of Linear Parameter Varying methods within the framework of vehicle dynamics, e.g. proposed control-oriented model, complex enough to handle some system non linearities but still simple for control or observer design, take into account the adaptability of the vehicle's response to driving situations, to the driver request and/or to the road sollicitations, manage interactions between various actuators to optimize the dynamic behavior of vehicles. This book results from the 32th International Summer School in Automatic that held in Grenoble, France, in September 2011, where recent methods (based on robust control and LPV technics), then applied to the control of vehicle dynamics, have been presented. After some theoretical background and a view on some recent works on LPV approaches (for modelling, analysis, control, observation and diagnosis), the main emphasis is put on road vehicles but some illustrations are concerned with railway, aerospace and underwater vehicles. The main objective of the book is to demonstrate the value of this approach for controlling the dynamic behavior of vehicles. It presents, in a rm way, background and new results on LPV methods and their application to vehicle dynamics.},

In this paper, we present recent developments in four basic problems in actuator control-friction, deadzone, backlash, and saturation. We apply intelligent control techniques for compensation of those nonlinearities for a class of nonlinear systems. Static and dynamic compensators using neural networks are considered. Different control structures are developed for common actuator nonlinearities. We present tuning algorithms for those intelligent compensation techniques that guarantee small tracking error and bounded internal states. Simulation results show that the proposed compensation schemes are efficient way of improving the tracking performance of nonlinear systems with backlash.},

We consider both homogeneous groups, where the time-varying parameters are identical, and heterogeneous groups, where the parameters can be different for all agents. Motivated by relative sensing we assume static, possibly parameter-varying, diffusive couplings between neighboring agents. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for state consensus and, in the homogeneous case, present design procedures for the coupling gains based on linear matrix inequalities.},

 abstract = {The paradigm of 'multi-agent' cooperative control is the challenge frontier for new control system application domains, and as a research area it has experienced a considerable increase in activity in recent years. This volume, the result of a UCLA collaborative project with Caltech, Cornell and MIT, presents cutting edge results in terms of the 'dimensions' of cooperative control from leading researchers worldwide. This dimensional decomposition allows the reader to assess the multi-faceted landscape of cooperative control. {\dq}Cooperative Control of Distributed Multi-Agent Systems{\dq} is organized into four main themes, or dimensions, of cooperative control: distributed control and computation; adversarial interactions; uncertain evolution; and, complexity management. The military application of autonomous vehicles systems or multiple unmanned vehicles is primarily targeted; however much of the material is relevant to a broader range of multi-agent systems including cooperative robotics, distributed computing, sensor networks and data network congestion control. {\dq}Cooperative Control of Distributed Multi-Agent Systems{\dq} offers the reader an organized presentation of a variety of recent research advances, supporting software and experimental data on the resolution of the cooperative control problem. It will appeal to senior academics, researchers and graduate students as well as engineers working in the areas of cooperative systems, control and optimization.},

The main idea is for individual components to model interactions with neighbors as disturbances that satisfy certain magnitude bounds while simultaneously self-imposing symmetric magnitude bounds. These magnitude bounds can be interpreted as negotiated levels of interaction among components. It turns out that this approach is equivalent to constructing a feedback that is robustly stabilizing with structured uncertainties.},

@article{SpBrSlSaAd11,
 abstract = {Displacement feedback control of a cantilever beam is studied using non-collocated piezoelectric patch sensors and actuators. The solution to the problem is obtained using two different methods, one analytical and another numerical. The analytical method involves an integral equation formulation of the problem where the eigensolutions of the integral equation are shown to be the eigensolutions of the governing differential equation of motion of the smart beam. This approach eliminates the difficulties associated with discontinuities caused by patch sensors and actuators which introduce Heaviside functions and derivatives of the Heaviside functions into the differential equation formulation. The numerical method of solution uses a finite-element model of the controlled beam with modified beam element mass and stiffness matrices to account for the piezo patches and the control effect. The control circuit consists of a piezoceramic and polyvinylidene fluoride sensor patch and a lead zirconium titanate actuator patch. The mass and stiffness of the piezoceramic actuator patch are taken into account in the mass and stiffness calculations. Numerical examples with non-collocated sensor and actuator patches are presented and the first three natural frequencies are given using the integral equation and the finite-element methods. The results of these methods match very closely which provides a verification of the results.},

We establish a new integral quadratic constraint (IQC), which captures the magnitude roll-off at high frequencies. The benefit of the roll-off IQC is exemplified in a study of the stability of a cyclic interconnection structure. When used in conjunction with the IQC describing passivity, we obtain a stability bound on the gain that depends on the size of the delay and relaxes a small-gain bound.},

 abstract = {We consider networks of passive systems with time delays in the interconnections, and present a stability analysis technique with the help of the integral quadratic constraint (IQC) framework. Unlike the classical passivity approach that fails to characterize delay robustness, and the small-gain approach that conservatively accounts for arbitrarily large delays, the new technique gives sharp stability estimates that depend on the duration of delay. Since the effect of delay depends on its duration relative to the time scales of the system, we make use of a ``roll-off'' IQC that captures magnitude roll-off at high frequencies, thus, providing the critical time-scale information. We then combine this roll-off IQC with an output strict passivity IQC that incorporates gain and phase information, and demonstrate the benefit of this combined IQC approach on a cyclic interconnection structure with delay. Finally, we develop a technique to verify these IQCs for classes of nonlinear state-space models and present an example from Internet congestion control.},

 abstract = {This book studies the original results, and their extensions, of the Russian mathematician, S.A. Gergorin, who wrote a seminal paper in 1931, on how to easily obtain estimates of all n eigenvalues (characteristic values) of any given n-by-n complex matrix. Since the publication of this paper, there has been many newer results spawned by his paper, and this book will be the first which is devoted solely to this resulting area. As such, it will include the latest research results, such as Brauer ovals of Cassini and Brualdi lemniscates, and their comparisons. This book is dedicated to the late Olga Taussky-Todd and her husband, John Todd. It was Olga who brought to light Gergorin's paper and its significance to the mathematical world. The level of this book requires only a modest background in linear algebra and analysis, and is therefore comprehensible to upper-level and graduate level students in mathematics.},

@article{VaFeBr01,
 abstract = {Sheet and film processes, which include papermaking, polymer film extrusion, and adhesive coating, are of substantial industrial importance. The processes are poorly conditioned and truly large scale, with up to hundreds of manipulated variables and thousands of sensor locations. The uncertainties in sheet and film process models require that they be explicitly taken into account during the control design procedure. Numerically efficient algorithms are developed that provide robust optimal controllers for a wide variety of uncertainty descriptions. The robust optimality of the controllers can be relaxed to provide low order controllers suitable for real time implementation. Robust controllers are designed for a simulated paper machine, based on a realistic description of the interactions across the machine, and the level of model inaccuracies.},

For general dynamic (frequency dependent) IQC-multipliers it is shown that, once the conditions of the IQC-theorem are satisfied, it is possible to construct a nonnegative Lyapunov function that satisfies a dissipation inequality. This not only shows that IQCs can be interpreted as dynamic supply functions, but also opens the way to merge frequency-domain techniques with time-domain conditions known from Lyapunov-theory.},

Then, we summarize the fundamental issues in NCSs and examine them with different underlying network-scheduling protocols. We present NCS models with network-induced delay and analyze their stability using stability regions and a hybrid systems technique. Following that, we discuss methods to compensate network-induced delay and present experimental results over a physical network. Then, we model NCSs with packet dropout and multiple-packet transmission as asynchronous dynamical systems and analyze their stability. Finally, we present our conclusions},

@book{WhZhCh13,
 abstract = {The objective of this brief is to carefully illustrate a procedure of applying linear parameter-varying (LPV) control to a class of dynamic systems via a systematic synthesis of gain-scheduling controllers with guaranteed stability and performance. The existing LPV control theories rely on the use of either H-infinity or H2 norm to specify the performance of the LPV system.  The challenge that arises with LPV control for engineers is twofold. First, there is no systematic procedure for applying existing LPV control system theory to solve practical engineering problems from modeling to control design. Second, there exists no LPV control synthesis theory to design LPV controllers with hard constraints. For example, physical systems usually have hard constraints on their required performance outputs along with their sensors and actuators. Furthermore, the H-infinity and H2 performance criteria cannot provide hard constraints on system outputs. As a result, engineers in industry could find it difficult to utilize the current LPV methods in practical applications. To address these challenges, gain-scheduling control with engineering applications is covered in detail, including the LPV modeling, the control problem formulation, and the LPV system performance specification. In addition, a new performance specification is considered which is capable of providing LPV control design with hard constraints on system outputs. The LPV design and control synthesis procedures in this brief are illustrated through an engine air-to-fuel ratio control system, an engine variable valve timing control system, and an LPV control design example with hard constraints. After reading this brief, the reader will be able to apply a collection of LPV control synthesis techniques to design gain-scheduling controllers for their own engineering applications. This brief provides detailed step-by-step LPV modeling and control design strategies along with a new performance specification so that engineers can apply state-of-the-art LPV control synthesis to solve their own engineering problems. In addition, this brief should serve as a bridge between the H-infinity and H2 control theory and the real-world application of gain-scheduling control.},

 abstract = {In this paper, a distributed robust control scheme is proposed for formation stabilization of noholonomic wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) with parametric uncertainty and actuator saturations. A quasi-LPV model is first established to describe the error dynamics of each WMR. For a given cost function, we generate distributed optimal control problems for each interacting robot whose error dynamics and constraints are uncoupled. In the framework of LMI optimization, a distributed moving horizon H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}infin{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} control scheme is consequently formulated as on-line solving each constrained optimal problem synchronously at each sampling time. We also discuss the closed-loop properties inclusive of stability and H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}infin{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} performance. Simulation is performed to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed distributed control law},

@article{YuChCa10,
 abstract = {This paper studies some necessary and sufficient conditions for second-order consensus in multi-agent dynamical systems. First, basic theoretical analysis is carried out for the case where for each agent the second-order dynamics are governed by the position and velocity terms and the asymptotic velocity is constant. A necessary and sufficient condition is given to ensure second-order consensus and it is found that both the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the corresponding network play key roles in reaching consensus. Based on this result, a second-order consensus algorithm is derived for the multi-agent system facing communication delays. A necessary and sufficient condition is provided, which shows that consensus can be achieved in a multi-agent system whose network topology contains a directed spanning tree if and only if the time delay is less than a critical value. Finally, simulation examples are given to verify the theoretical analysis.},

 abstract = {{\dq}Systems with delays appear frequently in engineering; typical examples include communication networks, chemical processes and tele-operation systems. The presence of delays makes system analysis and control design much more complicated. During the last decade, we have witnessed significant developments in robust control of time-delay systems. This volume presents a systematic and comprehensive treatment for robust (H-infinity) control of such systems in the frequency domain. The emphasis is on systems with a single input or output delay, although the delay-free part of the plant can be multi-input-multi-output, in which case the delays in different channels should be the same.{\dq} {\dq}This synthesis of the author's recent work covers the whole range of robust control of time-delay systems: from controller parameterization and design to controller implementation; from the Nehari and one-block problems to the four-block problem; from theoretical developments to practical issues. The major tools used in this book are similarity transformation, the chain-scattering approach and J-spectral factorization. The idea is, in the words of Albert Einstein, to {\dq}make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler{\dq}. A website associated with the book is a source of MATLAB and Simulink material which will assist with simulation and modelling of the material in the text.{\dq} {\dq}Robust Control of Time-delay Systems is self-contained and will interest control theorists, researchers and mathematicians working with time-delay systems and engineers looking to design commercial controllers or to use them in plants or communication systems with time delays. Its methodical approach will also be of value to graduates studying either general robust control theory or its particular applications in time-delay systems.{\dq}--Jacket.},

 abstract = {Abstract

This paper presents an integrated and practical control strategy to solve the leader--follower quadcopter formation flight control problem. To be specific, this control strategy is designed for the follower quadcopter to keep the specified formation shape and avoid the obstacles during flight. The proposed control scheme uses a hierarchical approach consisting of model predictive controller (MPC) in the upper layer with a robust feedback linearization controller in the bottom layer. The MPC controller generates the optimized collision-free state reference trajectory which satisfies all relevant constraints and robust to the input disturbances, while the robust feedback linearization controller tracks the optimal state reference and suppresses any tracking errors during the MPC update interval. In the top-layer MPC, two modifications, i.e. the control input hold and variable prediction horizon, are made and combined to allow for the practical online formation flight implementation. Furthermore, the existing MPC obstacle avoidance scheme has been extended to account for small non-apriorily known obstacles. The whole system is proved to be stable, computationally feasible and able to reach the desired formation configuration in finite time. Formation flight experiments are set up in Vicon motion-capture environment and the flight results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation flight architecture.},

 abstract = {This paper addresses the consensus problem of multiagent systems with a time-invariant communication topology consisting of general linear node dynamics. A distributed observer-type consensus protocol based on relative output measurements is proposed. A new framework is introduced to address in a unified way the consensus of multiagent systems and the synchronization of complex networks. Under this framework, the consensus of multiagent systems with a communication topology having a spanning tree can be cast into the stability of a set of matrices of the same low dimension. The notion of consensus region is then introduced and analyzed. It is shown that there exists an observer-type protocol solving the consensus problem and meanwhile yielding an unbounded consensus region if and only if each agent is both stabilizable and detectable. A multistep consensus protocol design procedure is further presented. The consensus with respect to a time-varying state and the robustness of the consensus protocol to external disturbances are finally discussed. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is demonstrated through numerical simulations, with an application to low-Earth-orbit satellite formation flying.},
